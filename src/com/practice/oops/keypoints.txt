A java programme can contain any number of classes but at most one class can be declared as "public".
If there is a public class in java Programme the name of public class and the name of java source file must be matched.

If there is no public class then we can use any name for java source file name and there are no restrictions.

javac Durga.java - generates A.class/B.class/C.class files (as all these three are java programmes) but while running/executing
java programme (java.A/java.B/java.C) corresponding java programme main method will be executed.
java Durga.java --> leads to RE: NoClassDefFoundError:Durga

We can compile a java programme but not a particular class, we can run a java class (.class file) but not java programme.

It is highly recommended to take only one class per src file (.java file) and name of the class and name of the programme
must be matched, this improves readability and understandability of the application

While resolving class names compiler will always gives the precedence in the following order
    Explicit class import
    classes present in working directory
    implicit class import

The following two packages are not required to import, because these packages and classes by default available to every java programme
    java.lang package
    current working package

 "import statements" are totally compile time issue, more no of imports, more will be compile time, but there is no effect on execution time.


 Explanation about System.out.println() :|
    System  --> It is class present in java.lang package
    out     --> It is a static variable of type PrintStream present in System class
    println --> It is a method present in the PrintStream class

 Every "wrapper class" in java we can find the two constants
    MAX_VALUE
    MIN_VALUE

 Every method present inside final class is always final whether we declared or not,
 but every variable present inside final class need not be final.
 main advantage of final keyword is - we can achieve security as no one is allowed to create child class/override a method.
 main disadvantage of final keyword is we are missing key benefits of OOPs concepts like
    inheritance (not creating child class because of final keyword)
    polymorphism (not overriding a method because of final keyword)

  Protected modifier: We can access "protected" members within the current package from anywhere and
  we can use either parent class reference or child class reference but form outside package
  we can access "protected" access members only in child classes that to with help of child class reference only i.e;
  from outside package we can't access "protected" members by using "parent reference".
